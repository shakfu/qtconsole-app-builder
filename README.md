# qtconsole-app-builder

A python script to build [qtconsole](https://github.com/jupyter/qtconsole) as a macOS `.app` bundle using [py2app](https://github.com/ronaldoussoren/py2app).


## Usage

It's pretty simple:

```bash

python3 create_qtconsole_app.py

```

This will create a virtualenv called `qtenv`, and after it concludes you should find `QtConsoleApp.app` in `qtenv/dist`.
